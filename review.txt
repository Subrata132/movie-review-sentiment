There's something special about this movie. It makes you feel special, it makes you feel you can do it. It makes you to listen to your heart.
The character is just like a normal person, day to day guy like, you and me. But one turn in life and, some calls from, well may I say the hidden part of us, leads to unnatural adventures.
To the edge of the world, to the icing water of Atlantic, to the heart of a volcano, or to the majestic enormous of Himalayans.
This kind of movie whispers near your ear- 'Let's go for an adventure!'
